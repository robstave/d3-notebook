Quick notes for team before starting.
 - Just about everything we do is in Angular and responsive.  So it is best to sandbox it that way as well.  This does mean that a lot of what you find on the web will be unfinished.
 - There is a big difference between V3 and V5.  We want V5.
 - The Enter/Exit pattern is best for dynamic data.  This makes for a challenge at times.
 - Practice, practice, bookmark, steal, practice.
